# Active Documentation

This tool is an [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) plugin. 

- It communicates with the [Main Component](https://github.com/devuxd/active-doc-client/blob/RulePad-version) using "Web-Socket".
- It is based on _srcML_ library, which should be installed as instructed [here](https://github.com/devuxd/active-doc-client/wiki#installing-srcml).

There are two files `ruleTable.json` for storing design rules and `tagTable.json` for storing tags.
The format of these files are described [here](https://github.com/devuxd/active-doc-client/blob/RulePad-version/README.md).
